# postUp

Most of the logic in this project including the database design and like, comment functionality is mine. Not sure if it is the standard way to do it, but it gets the job done. User and Post related CRUD functionality is in place.

CAUTION- Security related packages are not installed at this point in time

## Notable features

- Email verification functionality (it is yet to be implemented)
- Image upload and storage functionality (it is also yet to be implemented)
- Chat functionality (this is a big bet but I plan to integrate this in the future)
